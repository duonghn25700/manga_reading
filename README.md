# Manga Reading
Deploy a server to read your own manga. I have some interesting features like intelligently suggesting similar manga based on the description of the story.

1. create a database with informations on utils/manga_db.py
2. crawl_beetoon2sql_v4.py : crawl manga data from web
3. Run main.py then call api
4. 
Check all callable api on apimanga.docx
